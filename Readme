# ğŸ§  AgentAutogen â€“ Multi-Agent Java Code Generator

This project demonstrates a **multi-agent reasoning pipeline** that takes a vague feature request (e.g., _"Add JWT login"_) and turns it into:

1. A structured product requirement (PM)
2. A software architecture design (Architect)
3. Working Java code and `pom.xml` (Coder)
4. A final review report (Reviewer)

It uses **LLaMA 3.x via Ollama** and runs fully **locally** â€“ no OpenAI API key required!
